Notes:Postman API Test
-- The Postman API test run with a 100% pass rate, i.e the Login Success and Login Error scripts.
   Please see the collections and environments folder included. 


Notes:Python BDD
-- The Behave BDD test run with a 100% pass rate when ran on Chrome browser,but not for Firefox and Edge.
-- I have set up a crossbrowser test option for chrome and firefox which demonstrates this. 
-- I have added more negative tests using Behave Scenerio Outline and Examples applying a low level approach to the feature file, this 
   could easily be converted to a high level none technical feature file for non technical stakeholders.
